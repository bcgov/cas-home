# Backing up openshift secrets

Openshift secrets should be backed up in the team's shared secret vault.
So far, this is a manual process, that would greatly benefit from being automated.

The secrets should be backed up:
- monthly
- whenever a database password / user is regenerated by the postgres operator
- Generally, whenever a secret is generated and used by our infrastructure

### Process:
- run `make backup_secrets` from our cas-pipeline repo
- upload the resulting compressed file as a 'Document' type to the team's shared secret vault, without altering the name
- delete the local copy of the compressed file!
