# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is our database of choice. It is:

- extensible (e.g. XML support, PostGIS extension)
- supports unit testing (with [pgTap](https://pgtap.org/))
- scalable across multiple nodes with Citus
- highly available with Patroni
- allowing access to other databases using foreign data wrappers
- allowing functions written in various programming languages
- support for fine-grained role-based permissions and row-level security policies

## Resources

- The [official docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html) are always a good place to find the most in-depth information
- [The art of PostgreSQL](https://theartofpostgresql.com/) is a recommended read
